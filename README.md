# Hey, I’m Riyan 👋

I’m a full-stack developer who enjoys turning ideas into fast, reliable, and well-structured web applications.  
I care about **clean code**, **performance**, and building things that actually get used — not just demos that collect dust.

I like modern tools, but I respect fundamentals. Trends fade, good architecture doesn’t.
